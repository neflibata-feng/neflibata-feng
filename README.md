# Hi, I'm neflibata-feng 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate back-end developer currently studying Software Engineering. I specialize in building efficient and reliable systems, with a focus on integrating **AI Agent** technologies for autonomous decision-making.

## 🚀 About Me
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently a second-year Software Engineering student, focusing on **back-end development** and expanding my knowledge in the application and development of **AI Agents**.
- 🖥️ My primary programming language is **Java**, and I am deeply involved in **Spring Boot** framework development. I am also self-learning **Python** to broaden my technical expertise.
- 🔍 Currently, I am working on a **multi-data source integrated internet personal loan risk control system**, emphasizing **data security** and **risk management**.

## 📚 Research & Thesis
My thesis revolves around **AI Agents**, exploring how to design and develop intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision-making and human interaction. The research focuses on the application of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in optimizing agent behavior and adaptive learning.

Core topics of my thesis include:
- Autonomous decision-making models for **AI Agents**
- Applications of **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Learning** in AI agents
- Adaptive learning mechanisms: How AI Agents adjust based on environmental changes
